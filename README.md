This are two q-learning proejcts.
First one is q-learning with 2 states, each states has 10 different action with ramdonmly probabilities. Another one is 4 states with one end states, each state has 2-3 actions with different probabilities. The goal of this project is to find out if q-learning algorithm could find the best action with varibale environments.
